            <h2>How It Came to Be</h2>
            <img src="/pics/about-me-2.jpg" alt="cluttered desk">
            <p>The journey of Crochet Creations began quite unexpectedly on a cold winter afternoon. While searching for a thoughtful gift for a close friend, I was frustrated with the lack of 
                options for truly personal, handmade gifts. I wanted something special, something that felt like a piece of me—something that would stand out and bring warmth into their life. 
                With a crochet hook and a spark of creativity, I decided to make something myself. What began as a simple bag blossomed into a full-fledged hobby, and then a business, as friends 
                and family encouraged me to share my creations with the world. Thus, Small Hands Creations was born—a place where the joy of handmade goods meets the art of crochet to inspire, 
                teach, and share this beautiful craft with everyone.</p>
